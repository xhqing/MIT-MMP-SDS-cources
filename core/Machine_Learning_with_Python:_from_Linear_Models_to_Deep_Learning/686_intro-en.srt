1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,220
Have you ever wondered how your cellphone

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,700
can detect objects and discriminate between boats

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,170
and a bridge?

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,910
Or were you ever surprised when Amazon

5
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:15,870
was able to recommend you a book that you didn't even

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,960
know that you wanted it.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:22,200
So those are just two examples of what machine learning

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,330
technology can do for you today.

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,670
But imagine what it can do in all other areas of our lives.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,340
And part of our job at MIT is actually

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,830
to imagine this future.

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,870
And here we're working on all different application

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,910
of machine learning and AI, ranging from drug discovery,

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,110
identifying who may be sick, or developing new robotics

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,220
applications, or helping people to live happier and longer.

16
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,970
So there are lots and lots of applications

17
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,730
out there, but what's so interesting about it--

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,250
that in terms of algorithms, there

19
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,900
is a relatively small toolkit of algorithms

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,910
you need to learn to understand how

21
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,810
these different applications can work so nicely

22
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,910
and be integrated in our daily life.

23
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,180
So that's what this class is about--

24
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,860
understanding this technology.

25
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,520
And I hope that, by the end of this class,

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,490
you would actually know how your cellphone can detect bridges.

27
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:37,088
